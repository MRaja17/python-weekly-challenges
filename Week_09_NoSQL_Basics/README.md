# Week 09 – NoSQL Basics Challenges

## Easy 1  
NoSQL is a type of database that does not use the traditional tables and rows structure like SQL databases. 
Instead, NoSQL stores data in flexible formats such as documents, key–value pairs, wide-column stores, or graphs.

The key concept of NoSQL is:
- It handles unstructured or semi-structured data.
- It scales easily across many servers (horizontal scaling).
- It allows fast read/write operations for large datasets.
- It does not require a fixed schema, so data can change at any time.

In simple words, NoSQL gives more flexibility and speed for handling big and changing data compared to traditional SQL databases.
